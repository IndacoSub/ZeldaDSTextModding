# ZeldaDSTextModding

## Info ##

A "suite" of tools aimed to streamline (text) modding for mainline DS Zelda games (aka Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks).

The tools could use a few optimizations, so contributions are welcome!

Dependencies:
- Visual Studio 2022 with C# support (if you wish to compile the BMG Randomizer)
- Python 3.6 (or newer)
- ndspy (https://github.com/RoadrunnerWMC/ndspy)

**Note:** The original BMGRandomizerSharp is now semi-deprecated in favor of **BMGRandomizerSharpGUI**, which offers everything the former did — and more.

## GUI Usage

To run the GUI version:

1. Ensure Python ≥ 3.6 and ndspy are installed.
2. Create a folder named `tools` in the same directory as the executable.
3. Move the included `.py` files from this repository into the `tools` folder.
